# Agent Instructions for Multi-API Research Assistant

Welcome! Before making any changes, **you must read** the following project documents in the `docs/` directory:

1. `requirements.md`
2. `commit-plan.md`
3. `architecture.md`

These files define the product requirements, planned implementation sequence, and current architecture decisions. Treat them as living documents.

## Working Rules

- Review the three documents above before starting any task so you understand the current scope and plan.
- Update all three documents whenever your work modifies requirements, architecture, or the delivery plan. Include clear notes about what changed and why.
- If you finish a planned task, mark the corresponding item in `commit-plan.md` as complete by striking it through.
- When you deviate from the plan or discover new information, document the deviation in `commit-plan.md` (strike through the old expectation and append the new plan) and record requirement or architecture impacts in the other documents.
- If any automated or manual tests fail, record the failure details and current status in the relevant sections of `commit-plan.md` and `requirements.md`.
- Keep all documentation synchronized with the implementation state before you conclude your work.

Thank you for keeping the project organized!
